I encourage you to dive into this code and build something fit for your needs!  To begin, you'll need the data architecture.

Use the free version of [Db2 Event Store](https://ibm.co/2HrSHLG) to get started.  Db2 comes with embedded Jupyter notebooks where you can connect to the new free tier of [Db2 On Cloud](https://ibm.co/2HrSHLG).

Db2 provides the foundation for AI apps. With the new free tiers, there should be nothing holding you back from getting your hands dirty.
